# ML - Clustering   

## Objective
This project demonstrates **unsupervised machine learning** techniques using **KMeans Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering** on the **Iris dataset**. The purpose is to group similar data points without predefined labels and visualize the clustering results.  

## Dataset 
The Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets` is used for the evaluation, which contains **150 samples** of iris flowers with **four features** each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).  

### 1. Loading and Preprocessing
- Load the dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
- Handle missing values and perform feature scaling.
- Explanation of preprocessing steps included.

### 2. **Clustering Techniques Implemented**  
a) **KMeans Clustering**  
   - KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that assigns data points to clusters based on proximity to centroids.  
   - This project applies KMeans with **3 clusters** (as there are 3 species of iris).  
   - The results are visualized using scatter plots.

b) **Hierarchical Clustering**  
   - Hierarchical clustering creates a tree-like structure of nested clusters.  
   - This project applies **Agglomerative Clustering** with **3 clusters** using the Ward linkage method.  
   - A Scatterplot **dendrogram** is generated to visualize the hierarchical relationships between clusters.

## Results
- KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering successfully group the Iris dataset into three distinct clusters.
- The clustering results confirm that the dataset has natural groupings corresponding to different iris species.
